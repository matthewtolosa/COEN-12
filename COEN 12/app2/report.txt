/*Report for Big O run-times for application two

COEN 12: Data Structures 

The data structure that I used was a sorted array that points to a student struct 
at each index of the array. The array is sorted by id. Because the second application 
has frequent calls to search, then I wanted to optimize that big O run time. Therefore 
I used a sorted array because I could use binary search which has a worst case big O run
time of O(logn). I also considered using a hash table for my data structure because the 
expected big O run time for searching is O(1). However that is only if you have no 
collisions, thus the worst case big O run time is O(n). 


Big O Run-Times:
createDataSet: O(1)
destroyDataSet: O(n)
searchID: O(logn)
insertion: O(n)
deletion: O(n)
